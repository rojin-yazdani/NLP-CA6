# Training a Machine Translator (openNMT-py tool)

## Introduction
This exercise was completed in preparation for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course at [Tehran University](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in 2020.

In this exercise, we're going to get to know the steps of training a machine translator based on neural network and the parameters that affect it.

For this purpose, we use the openNMT-py tool, which is an open-source tool for machine translation based on neural networks, and various sequence-to-sequence models are implemented in it.

In addition to machine translation, this tool can also be used for other tasks such as speech to text, image to text summarization, etc.

To know how to install and use this tool, as well as to learn about its parameters, you can use the two links below:

Two tasks of English to Farsi translation and Farsi to English transliteration have been considered in this exercise, which you must teach these two systems and answer the questions.
